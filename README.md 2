# Web Crawler Scrapy of APP Store(Xiaomi)

## Description
We will create a Scrapy project to crawl the content in the Xiaomi Appstore homepage or any other Appstore homepage. Then Save the crawled content in MongoDB. Install Python MongoDB driver and modify pipelines.py to insert crawled data into MongoDB. Crawl more content by following next page links. 

In this real application, we dealt with different kinds of challenges like dynamic JavaScript by Splash+ ScrapyJS or IP being blocked by random useragent.

Finally, I grab 38535 items of Xiaomi appstore, each item contain the information of appid, appname, description, catagory, company name, and title.

### Time
We started this project on 06/04/2016 and have done on 07/02/2017.

### [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVAR5syRljc&feature=youtu.be)

### Usage
1. Install Scrapy, MongoDB, Splash and ScrapyJS.(If you already have, skil this step. ）
  - [Scrapy](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html)
  - [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/installation/)
  - [Splash](https://splash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)
  - [ScrapyJS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scrapyjs)
2. Start your Splash and MongoDB server.
    + under catalog /MongoDB/bin:
    
        ```bash
        ./mongod
        ```
        
    + On the Terminal of docker:

        ```bash
        docker run -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash
        ```

3. Clone a copy of the main appstore crawler repo by running:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnkaiLiang/-12WebCralwer.git
    ```

4. Modify the file -12WebCralwer/appstore_crawler/appstore_crawler/settings.py.
Set your Splash server address and the information of MongoDB. 
In my case, it's :

    ```python
    SPLASH_URL = 'http://192.168.99.100:8050'
    MONGODB_SERVER = "localhost"
    MONGODB_PORT = 27017
    MONGODB_DB = "Xiaomi"
    MONGODB_COLLECTION = "appdate"
    ```

5. Go to the catalog /appstore_crawler/, Run the crawler:

    ```bash
    scrapy crawl xiaomi
    ```
